# CoreMLDetection
This is a sample iOS project for using Vision with Core ML to identify scenes in images.
Tested and runs on latest Beta (at this time **XCode 9 Beta 2**). This is a Universal app.

## Setup
* You'll need to download a Core ML model (some samples here: https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/
* Add your .mlmodel file to the Xcode Project (include in Target, or it won't compile)
* Make code change for your new model name
* Change automic provisioning to your team (currently None)
* Run and enjoy!
